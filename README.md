# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements.

# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
    
- **Clarity and Understanding:** It helps in 
understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
- **Scope Definition:** Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
- **Basis for Design and Development:** Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
- **Cost and Time Estimation:** Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
- **Quality Assurance:** Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.

- **Requirement Gathering:** The process of conducting interviews with stakeholders to identify user goals and and needs

- **Requirement Elicitation:** This process involves In creating prototypes and brainstorming ideas for stakeholders to visualize systems and refine their requirements.

- **Requirement Documentation:** This process involves creating documents that lists all non functional and functional requirements of the project scope, from writing user stories to creating diagrams to show interactions between users and the system

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** This is the part where team prioritize base on most important tasks of the system

- **Requirement Validation:** This process involves Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness by defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.

# Types of Requirements
## Functional Requirements 
    Describe what the system should do.
    Examples: User authentication, property search, booking system, user registration.

## Non-functional Requirements 
    Describe how the system should perform.
    Examples: Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.

# Use Case Diagrams.
Visual representation of interactions between users and the system show how different users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases) by using tools like draw.io to draw interactions between actors and use cases.

# Acceptance Criteria.
Acceptance criteria are conditions that a feature must meet to be accepted by the stakeholders, mostly by being specific and measurable, Include functional and non-functional aspects.

## Example for Booking System: 
Users should be able to select available dates, confirm booking, and receive a confirmation email within 2 minutes.‚Äù
